If you find a bug, or have a feature request, please add an issue on Github, the website for this extension.\n\nRelease Notes:\n* 0.5.0: This version adds the ability to store your link history in your local browser. This only stores Nanotation links, and you can turn it off at any time or clear your link history.\n\n* 0.4.5: This is a breaking change from previous versions. This version uses a more compact URL syntax, resulting in greater stability and shorter links. I decided not to preserve backwards compatibility for better code maintenance and shorter code, and because there are so few current users, it\'s better to rip the bandaid early. Apologies for any inconvenience. If you\'ve already made several links you want to keep, please contact me, and I can write a converter.']"

Just set your coordinates and go.\n\nStellarium calculates the positions of the Sun and Moon, planets and stars, and draws how the sky would look to an observer depending on their location and the time. It can also draw the constellations and simulate astronomical phenomena such as meteor showers, and solar or lunar eclipses.\n\nStellarium may be used as an educational tool for teaching about the night sky, as an observational aid for amateur astronomers wishing to plan a night's observing, or simply as a curiosity (it's fun!). Because of the high quality of the graphics that Stellarium produces, it is used in some real planetarium projector products. Some amateur astronomy groups use it to create sky maps for describing regions of the sky in articles for newsletters and magazines.\n\nSome of Stellarium features:\n— Default catalogue of over 600,000 stars.\n— Extra catalogues with more than 210 million stars.\n— Asterisms and illustrations of the constellations.\n— Constellations for 15 different cultures.\n— Images of nebulae (full Messier catalogue).\n— Realistic Milky Way.\n— Very realistic atmosphere, sunrise and sunset.\n— The planets and their satellites.""]"

Затем игроки по очереди бросают кубики и ходят на выпавшее число клеток. Всего на поле 32 клетки. Когда круг заканчивается, игрок начинает его заново, получая 300 000 банкнот.\nБольшинство клеток - это города и курорты, которые игроки могут покупать и развивать - застраивать. Чем больше построек в городе, тем выше арендная плата за остановку в нем. Поэтому, когда на клетку города попадают другие игроки, они платят владельцу соответствующую сумму. \nТак же среди клеток есть Налоговая, где нужно уплатить процент от стоимости всех своих владений. Есть Затерянный остров, где игрок может просидеть в заключении несколько ходов, если не выбросит дубль. Есть Мировой турнир: попадая на него, игрок может назначить один из своих городов местом для проведения турнира, на время которого арендная плата повысится в несколько раз. Есть клетка Кругосветное путешествие, с которой игрок может отправиться на любую другую клетку на поле.\nТакже на поле есть 4 клетки «Шанс». Когда кто-нибудь попадает на одну из них, в размеренный ход игры вмешиваются самые неожиданные экономические факторы: землетрясение может разрушить любой город либо же игрок-предприниматель может выиграть непомерно большую сумму в лотерее.\nЧтобы победить, необходимо скупить клетки на одной стороне поля, либо скупить все туристические города, либо скупить все клетки трех любых цветов. Время на игру ограничено 20 минутами. Если к этому моменту никто из игроков не выполнил ни одного из трех условий победы, выигрывает тот, кто располагает самым большим капиталом.\nВ игре есть платные бонусы (повторный бросок кубиков, выпадение дубля, выпадение четного или нечетного числа и смена карточки «Шанс»).']"

Remember the easiest way to lose weight is by changing how you think about…', ""Use this theme when you are trying to lose weight.  Remember the easiest way to lose weight is by changing how you think about food.\n\nThe path to weight loss can be as much a mental and emotional quest as it is a physical one, and your commitment to bettering yourself is nothing short of admirable.\n\nFirstly, please know that you are so much more than the number on the scale or the reflection in the mirror. You are a tapestry of experiences, dreams, passions, and qualities that make you uniquely wonderful. Your decision to lose weight is but one facet of who you are, and while it’s an important journey for you, it doesn’t define your worth.\n\nIt’s perfectly okay to have moments of doubt, days when you feel like progress is slow, or times when you stumble. Every journey is marked by highs and lows, and yours will be no exception. Yet, it’s the overall trajectory that matters. As they say, it's not about how many times you fall, but about how many times you get back up.\n\nRemember to celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. Did you choose a healthier meal option today? Did you get up and move, even if it wasn’t as long or as intense as you’d planned? These are victories. Every single step you take, every wise choice you make, contributes to your overall goal.\n\nWhile setting goals is a crucial part of this journey, ensure they are realistic and kind. Unrealistic goals can set you up for disappointment, while achievable ones can keep you motivated. Break your long-term objectives into smaller milestones, and revel in the joy of accomplishing each one.\n\nBut as you move forward, it's vital to anchor your journey in more than just aesthetics. Consider the other, equally significant benefits: increased energy, better health, improved mood, and the sheer joy of accomplishing a challenge. When the journey feels hard, remember these reasons, and let them propel you forward.\n\nNutrition and exercise are cornerstones of weight loss, but self-love is just as crucial. Avoid comparing your progress to others’. Everyone's body is different, and everyone’s journey is personal. Social media and even friends can sometimes inadvertently set standards or timelines, but remember: this is your journey. It will be as unique as you are.\n\nAdditionally, consider surrounding yourself with supportive individuals – be it friends, family, or a community group. Sharing your challenges, seeking advice, or simply being understood can make a world of difference.\n\nThere might also be moments when you are tempted to resort to extreme measures or quick fixes. In these times, remember that enduring change takes time. Quick fixes might offer immediate results, but they rarely last and can be detrimental in the long run. Trust in the process, rely on proven methods, and seek expert advice when in doubt.\n\nBut perhaps most importantly, be kind to yourself. Celebrate the progress, not just the destination. There might be weeks when the scale doesn’t budge or days when old habits resurface, and that’s okay. Your journey isn’t linear, and these moments don’t signify failure but are part and parcel of the experience.\n\nBe patient. Weight loss isn’t just about shedding pounds but about building new habits, understanding your body, and establishing a connection with yourself. These things take time, and while it can be frustrating, the rewards – both tangible and intangible – are worth it.\n\nEnsure you’re also looking after your mental well-being. Reflect on what’s driving your weight loss journey. Make sure it’s coming from a place of love, self-betterment, and health, rather than from external pressures or negative self-perceptions.\n\nThroughout this process, take moments to pause and appreciate your body for what it is, what it does, and its incredible capacity for change. Bodies are marvels, regardless of their size or shape. Your body carries you, sustains you, and allows you to interact with the world around you. So, while it's okay to seek change, it's also essential to harbor gratitude.""]"

ldlghkoiihaelfnggonhjnfiabmaficg,QuicKey – The quick tab switcher,"['Add keyboard shortcuts to switch tabs with a Quicksilver-style search or a most recently used menu', 'No mouse needed!\n\n • Press ALT-Q (CTRL-Q on macOS)\n • Type a few letters\n • Press ENTER to switch to the selected tab\n\n\n★ Use CTRL-TAB to switch between recent tabs\n\nWith a little extra work, you can make QuicKey respond to the Holy Grail of keyboard shortcuts: CTRL-TAB.\n\nLearn how at https://fwextensions.github.io/QuicKey/ctrl-tab/\n\nYou can customize the shortcut keys (other than CTRL-TAB) by right-clicking the QuicKey icon and selecting Options.\n\n\n★ Switch between the most recently used tabs\n\n ➤ NOTE: When first installed, QuicKey doesn\'t know which tabs have been\n      recently used, but as you use the browser, tabs will get added to the\n      most recently used (MRU) list.\n\nOpening QuicKey displays a list of the last 50 tabs you\'ve visited, in order of recency. Click a tab to switch to it, or use one of the keyboard shortcuts below to navigate the recently used tab history:\n\n ➤ To switch between the two most recent tabs:\n    • Press ALT-Z (CTRL-Z on macOS).\n        OR:\n    • Quickly double-press ALT-Q (CTRL-Q on macOS).\n\n ➤ To navigate farther back in the MRU list:\n    • Press ALT-A (CTRL-A on macOS) once to switch to the previous tab.\n      The QuicKey icon will invert for .75 seconds.\n    • Press ALT-A while the icon is inverted to switch to older tabs, once\n      for each tab.\n    • Press ALT-S to move to newer tabs.\n    • Pause to let the icon revert to normal.\n    • Press ALT-A again to switch back to the tab you initially started on.\n\n ➤ To pick a recent tab from the MRU list:\n    • Press the shortcut but keep holding the ALT key (CTRL key on macOS).\n    • Press W or ↓ to move down through the list of recent tabs.\n    • Press SHIFT-W or ↑ to move up.\n    • Release ALT to switch to the selected tab.\n    • You can also highlight an item with the mouse, then release ALT to\n      go to that tab.\n\nWhich shortcuts to use is up to you. Double-pressing ALT-Q is nice because there\'s just one shortcut to remember, while ALT-Z lets you switch between the two most recently used tabs very rapidly. (You can also double-click the QuicKey icon to toggle between the most recent tabs.)\n\nALT-A lets you navigate to even older tabs, though the timing can sometimes be finicky.\n\nSelecting from the MRU menu by holding down the ALT key provides the closest experience to a typical ALT-TAB menu, but you need to use W instead of TAB to navigate while the menu is open.\n\nYou can change any of these shortcuts by clicking the gear icon in the menu or by right-clicking the QuicKey icon and selecting Options. Then scroll down and click ""Change browser shortcuts"". Look for the ""Switch to the previous/next tab"" shortcuts.\n\nIf you enable the option to show the number of open tabs on the QuicKey icon, the badge containing that number will change color while you navigate to older tabs, rather than the icon inverting.\n\n\n★ Search for a tab quickly\n\nUnlike other tab switchers, QuicKey uses a Quicksilver-style search algorithm to rank the results, where contiguous matches at the beginning of words are higher in the list, as are matches against capital letters. So you only have to type a few letters to quickly find the right tab.\n\nUse keyboard shortcuts to navigate the list:\n\n • ENTER: switch to the selected tab\n • ↓, SPACE or CTRL-N/J: move down the list\n • ↑, SHIFT-SPACE or CTRL-P/K: move up the list\n • PG DN: page down the list\n • PG UP: page up the list\n • END: go to the bottom of the list\n • HOME: go to the top of the list\n • ESC: clear the search or close the menu\n\nIf you type more than 25 letters, which should be plenty to find the right tab, QuicKey switches to an exact string search to stay fast.\n\nRecently used tabs get a slight boost in the search results ranking, so getting back to a tab you were just using should require typing fewer letters.\n\n\n★ Customize shortcuts and other options\n\nTo customize how QuicKey behaves, click the gear icon in the menu, or right-click its icon on the toolbar and select Options. There you can:\n\n • Customize keyboard shortcuts\n • Hide closed tabs from the search results\n • Limit navigating recent tabs or searching to the current browser window\n • Mark tabs in other browser windows with an icon\n • Show the number of open tabs\n • Use pinyin to search for Chinese characters\n\nIf you change the keyboard shortcut for showing the QuicKey menu to something other than the default ALT-Q or if you have a non-US keyboard, you\'ll probably want to also change the key that\'s used to navigate down the list of recently used tabs (which defaults to W). For instance, if you change the menu shortcut to ALT-Z, you might want to change the navigation key to X, which is right next door. To change it, go to the Options page, click the ""Select the next tab"" keyboard shortcut picker, and press X.\n\nWhen new settings have been added to QuicKey, the gear icon will display a red dot to let you know.\n\n\n★ Limit navigation to the current browser window\n\nIf you have multiple browser windows open, you may want to navigate among only the recent tabs that are in the current window. To enable this behavior, open the Options page and select ""Limit recent tabs to the current browser window"". Pressing the shortcuts for ""Switch instantly between the two most recent tabs"" or ""Switch to the previous tab"" will then switch only between recent tabs in the current window.\n\nYou can also limit searching for tabs to the current browser window.\n\n\n★ Close and reopen tabs\n\nTo close the selected tab, press CTRL-W (CMD-CTRL-W on macOS, CTRL-ALT-W on Linux). Or hover over a tab and click the X button on the right side of the menu.\n\nWhen you open QuicKey, the 25 most recently closed tabs are listed below the recent tabs and shown in a faded state with a clock icon. They are also returned when you type a query, though their rank in the list of results is lower than open tabs. Click a closed tab to reopen it in its original location and with all of its browsing history intact.\n\nIf you don\'t want any closed tabs to be shown, open the QuicKey options page and uncheck ""Include recently closed tabs in the search results"". You can also remove the selected closed tab from the browser\'s history by pressing CTRL-W (CMD-CTRL-W on macOS) or by clicking its X button on the right side of the menu.\n\n\n★ Move tabs\n\nYou can move tabs to the left or right of the current tab, making it easy to pull tabs from other windows into the current one, or to rearrange tabs without using the mouse.\n\n • Press CTRL-[ to move the selected tab to the left of the current one.\n • Press CTRL-] to move it to the right.\n\nThe CTRL key should be used on both Windows and macOS. Note that you cannot move tabs between normal and incognito windows.\n\n\n★ Distinguish tabs with identical titles\n\nA tab that has the same title as other open tabs will display a number to indicate its left-to-right position among those other tabs. For instance, if you open tabs for two different Google Drive accounts, they\'ll both be titled ""My Drive - Google Drive"". But the one on the left will show a ""1"" next to its title in the menu and the one on the right will show a ""2"". This makes it easier for you to select the tab you want when you know how they\'re organized in your window.\n\n\n★ Search bookmarks\n\nTo find a bookmark, type ""/b"" and a space in the search box, then part of the bookmark\'s name or URL.\n\n • Press ENTER to open it in the current tab.\n • Press CTRL-ENTER (CMD-ENTER on macOS) to open it in a new tab in\n   the current window.\n • Press SHIFT-ENTER to open it in a new window.\n\nAs soon as you type ""/b "", your bookmarks will be listed in alphabetical order, in case you want to browse through them. Since bookmarks can be organized into folders, the folder path is shown before each bookmark\'s title. The folder path can be hidden by unchecking ""Show the folder path to each bookmark in its title"" on the Options page.\n\n\n★ Search the browser history\n\nTo find something in the last 2000 pages of your browser history, type ""/h"" and a space in the search box, then part of the page\'s name or URL.\n\nThe same CTRL-ENTER (CMD-ENTER on macOS) and SHIFT-ENTER shortcuts will open the visited page in a new tab or window.\n\nAs soon as you type ""/h "", the pages from your history will be listed in order of recency, so you can get back to a page you had recently visited without having to remember its name.\n\n\n★ Delete bookmarks and history items\n\nTo delete the selected bookmark or history item, press CTRL-W (CMD-CTRL-W on macOS). Or hover over an item and click the X button on the right side of the menu. You\'ll be asked to confirm the deletion of bookmarks.\n\n\n★ Incognito mode\n\nTo switch to incognito tabs as well as normal ones, right-click the QuicKey icon and select Options from the menu. Scroll to the very bottom of the QuicKey options page and then click the ""Change incognito settings"" button. On the extensions page that opens, scroll down to the ""Allow in incognito"" option and click the toggle button next to it.\n\nTabs in incognito mode display the incognito icon under the page\'s favicon, so you can distinguish a normal tab from an incognito one with the same title.\n\n\n★ Copy a URL or title\n\nYou can also copy the URL and title of the selected tab, bookmark or history item:\n\n • Press CTRL-C (CMD-C on macOS) to copy just the URL.\n • Press CTRL-SHIFT-C (CMD-SHIFT-C on macOS) to copy both the item\'s\n   title and its URL, one per line.\n\n\n★ Privacy policy\n\nWhen first installed, QuicKey asks for these permissions:\n\n ➤ ""Read and change your browsing history on all your signed-in devices""\n\n      QuicKey uses this permission to let you search the titles and URLs of\n      the open tabs, as well as pages from your history. The ""all your\n      signed-in devices"" part is there only so that recently closed tabs can be\n      restored with their full history. The only time QuicKey changes your\n      browsing history is when you choose to delete a history item.\n\n ➤ ""Read and change your bookmarks""\n\n      QuicKey uses this permission to let you search the titles and URLs of\n      your bookmarked pages. The only time it changes your bookmarks is\n      when you choose to delete one.\n\nQuicKey can\'t access or manipulate the content of any pages you visit and doesn\'t transmit any information other than some anonymized diagnostic data.\n\nIf you right-click the QuicKey icon on the toolbar, there\'s a message saying ""Can\'t read or change site\'s data"", which is a bit misleading, since it can\'t read or change *any* site\'s data, not just the current one.\n\n\n★ Support and source code\n\nGet more information at https://fwextensions.github.io/QuicKey/\n\nReport a bug or request a feature at https://fwextensions.github.io/QuicKey/support/\n\nView the release history at https://fwextensions.github.io/QuicKey/releases\n\nSee the source code at https://github.com/fwextensions/QuicKey']"

You can also enable it as a page toolbar, so you look at advanced SEO metrics for every page.\n\nHere’s what you can do with the Link Research SEO Toolbar:\n• See the Power and Trust of a domain or page\n• Discover great places to get links from\n• See how successful a page is on social media\n• Understand user engagement\n• See the strongest pages by Keyword Ranking\n• Spot drastic changes in the number of links\n• See how many backlinks a page has.\n\nAll this is possible by looking at a set of powerful SEO metrics:\n• LRT Power*Trust for domains\n• LRT Power*Trust for pages\n• Buzz - social media signals\n• Impact - long-term user engagement metrics\n• Keyword Ranking\n• Link Velocity Trends\n• Number of Backlinks\n\nWhy LRT Power*Trust?\nBecause LRT Power*Trust is a precise, reliable and stable metric built by LinkResearchTools shortly after the first Google Penguin update in 2012, as a result of many years of research and calculations.\n\nForget about Google’s Toolbar PageRank. Google stopped updating it many years ago and completely removed it from their toolbar in April 2016. \n\nYou can think of LRT Power*Trust as a replacement for Google’s toolbar PageRank, but it’s so much more. LRT Power*Trust is the metric to look at when you want to assess the quality and trustworthiness of a page, domain or top domain.\n\nWhy Keyword Ranking?\nThe Link Research SEO Toolbar’s “Keyword Ranking” metric allows you to take a quick look at your competitors’ keyword rankings. By evaluating the keywords your competitors rank for, you will easily come up with new ideas for your content optimization.\n\nWhy Buzz?\nBuzz is Impactana’s aggregate of social media signals, divided into shares and likes. By using the Link Research SEO toolbar to sort the search results by Buzz, you can quickly find out what sort of content is “HOT” on social media. You can use Google’s time filter to see only the pages indexed in the past year, month or week.\n\nWhy Impact?\nThe Impact metric helps you discover strong content that people linked to a lot and engaged with by commenting or downloading it. This metric measures user engagement for any content, not only for the one that goes viral on social media. A good article about construction will not get shared on social media, but it may get many links or comments if it’s great.\n\nWhy link velocity trends?\nA website needs to have a steady link growth. Search engines can interpret unnatural link growth as a negative signal, which can lead to a loss in the rankings.  Google uses link growth trends to detect any algorithm manipulation attempts. If your backlink profile grows too fast, you’re out. If you’re too slow, you won’t ever get on the first page.\n\nWhy backlinks?\nGoogle confirmed links to be a top ranking factor. That's a very strong reason   to look at links whenever you analyse the strength of a page or domain.\n\n\nUpdate 0.0.3\n- Now with option to follow REL-Canonicals for Metrics of pages (requires fetch)\n- Loading animation\n\nUpdate 0.0.4\nNEW: SEO Toolbar for every page with all the important metrics \n- three different toolbar styles mini, bulky and skyscraper\n- drag&drop the toolbar around where you need it\n- open backlink checker right from the toolbar (requires LRT account)\n\nNEW: Fetch results from SERP to resolve redirects and show real SEO metrics\n\nSERP overlay\n- Backlink count shown for every SERP result\n- Sorting by backlink count in the SERPs\n\nUpdate 0.0.5\n- Domain exclusion feature: you can now choose to disable the Link Research SEO Toolbar for certain domains.\n\nUpdate 0.0.6\n- SERP overlay Chrome on/off settings bug fixes.\n- Chrome store listing updates.\n\nUpdate 0.0.7\n- SEO Toolbar minor fixes\n\nUpdate 0.0.8\n- Mini Toolbar load speed optimization.\n\nUpdate 0.0.9\n- Minor layout fixes and improvements.\n- Added knowledge graph hint.\n\nUpdate 0.0.10\n- We added a secret link to more cool extensions by LinkResearchTools.\n\nUpdate 0.1.0\n- on-off toggle layout update\n- backlink data enhancements\n- try LinkResearchTools button\n\nUpdate 0.1.2\n- Fixed issues with Google reCAPTCHA\n\nUpdate 0.1.3\n- Fixed issues with Google SERP overlay""]"

The Symbiote was originally introduced as a living alien costume in The Amazing Spider-Man #252 (May 1984), with a full first appearance as Venom in The Amazing Spider-Man #300 (May 1988).']"

Это позволяет использовать опыт\nдругих покупателей, чтобы быстро выбрать самый подходящий товар.\n\n💬 Отдельно показываются самые полезные цитаты из комментариев.\nЭта функция удобна для того, чтобы создать первое впечатление \nо товаре.

Можно следить сразу за несколькими товарами. Для этого,\nнужно нажать кнопку «Следить за ценой» на сайте quiddi и ввести\nадрес почты, на которую будут приходить данные о динамике цены.\n\nБлагодаря этим функциям сразу видно, на какие товары продавцов\nс Алиэкспресс стоит обратить внимание и изучить тщательнее, а на\nкакие не нужно тратить время. \n\nЗная динамику цен и рейтинг продавца, видя реальные фото товара,\nможно быстро выбрать самый подходящий и качественный товар\nна AliExpress.\n\nРасширение Quiddi для Алиэкспресс полностью бесплатно.

Whether you're drafting a blog post, tweaking a product description, or any other text-based task, Xagio is designed to elevate your content game. Here’s what you need to know in simple terms:\n\n1. What does it do?\nXagio employs Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist you in creating content. Imagine having a writing buddy who's always updated with the latest trends, understands the nuances of language, and can suggest improvements instantly. That's Xagio for you.\n\n2. How does it work?\nInstead of jumping between apps or websites, Xagio integrates right into your Chrome browser. Let's say you're writing an email or a blog post, and you're stuck or unsure about a sentence. Simply highlight the text, and Xagio will provide suggestions or even completely rephrase it for better clarity and engagement.\n\n3. Why AI-driven content?\nArtificial Intelligence analyzes vast amounts of data to understand patterns and preferences. With Xagio, this means your content isn't just based on gut feeling; it's backed by data-driven insights ensuring it resonates with your audience.\n\n4. Tailored to your needs:\nNot all content is created equal. A product description is different from a blog post or an email. Xagio lets you choose from different versions of its AI, known as GPT models, to ensure the assistance you receive is apt for your specific task.\n\n5. A community at your fingertips:\nWhat's better than one mind? Multiple minds! Xagio boasts a community feature where users share, vote on, and access AI prompts. These are essentially starting points or ideas for your content. Stuck on how to begin? Dive into the community's shared knowledge and find inspiration.\n\n6. Integration with popular platforms:\nIf you're using WordPress to manage a website or blog, Xagio seamlessly integrates with it. This means you can craft, refine, and upload content without the need to copy-paste or switch between tabs – it's all smooth and integrated.\n\n7. More than just original content:\nSometimes, you don't need to start from zero. Xagio allows you to pull information from other sources, refine and tweak it, ensuring you have a solid base to work from, saving time and effort.\n\n8. Everyone's invited:\nYou don’t have to break the bank to start with Xagio. They offer a freemium model, meaning you can use core features for free. If you love it and want more advanced capabilities, there are paid options available.\n\nIn a nutshell, the Xagio AI Chrome Extension is your next-generation writing buddy, making sure every piece of content you produce is top-notch. Whether you're a seasoned writer or someone just starting out, Xagio is designed to streamline, enhance, and simplify your content creation process. Give it a try and witness the content revolution firsthand!""]"

This allows printing of multiple labels at once without needing them in a purchase order. (This features has now been adapted by Lightspeed, but ours offers more customization.\n • From the Stock Order views, print only the labels you want and customize the quantities you want to print on sent and received orders. Plus, quick print one item from any order.\n• On the Receive page within Stock Orders, quick print individual lines of items as you receive them.\n\nFormatted Printing:\n • Printing from the Vend Products page or purchase orders gives ugly results with weirdly formatted pages. Take control with Vextend Office printing! Added interface buttons transfer all data from the currently visible products page or from any purchase order to a special window where you can format and print a concise view of your inventory or purchase order!\n • Optionally hide data columns, header details, or specific rows when printing.\n • Have fields with long data? Set a max number of characters to print for each column.\n\nStock Control\n• Various options for printing specific labels while in Stock Control.\n• Supercharge your Stock Control Receive page. Unmatched values between ordered/received display entire line as red to quickly track backordered/unmatched quantities. All items came in? Quickly bump the ordered number into the received column with a handy arrow. Once you have bumped, you can now print labels quickly right from that line (if API access enabled), and the 'Quick Print' button prevents the need of ever clicking print on the next page (configure Vextend label settings first, Chrome print dialog still appears unless your browser is in Kiosk mode).\n• Print better formatted views of the entire Stock Order on Open and Received Orders (not available on the Receive page).\n• KEY FEATURE! Enable API Access to unlock the stock order Super Import (still in Beta) where you can import new items, update existing items, and add them to a stock order all in one screen with a single CSV file. See the demo video on our help page to learn more.\n\nProducts Page:\n • Vend by default only loads 25 items from search results, but more load when scrolling to the bottom of the page (lazy load). Use the added full scroll button to automatically quick scroll to load all items. Handy for using the Vextend Office Print Table Feature\n • Select items to print labels for using the built in Vend check boxes.\n • Print the currently visible rows using the Vextend Print Table function.\n • If API Access is enabled, quickly edit the quantity in stock and retail price of items right from the product page along with viewing a list of all barcodes.\n\nGift Cards:\n • If API Access is enabled, get more details on the gift cards report page, edit cards, or even activate cards outside a sale.\n\n\nVextend Office is free to install with no subscriptions or fees.  Vextend Office is a privately developed extension and is not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Vend POS/Lightspeed.\n\nIf there's features you like, we highly encourage you to contact Vend support to make these features part of the core product! (Updates to Vend could at any time break any of these features, so direct support of these features in Vend would be ideal.)\n\nUpdate Log:\n0.3.0.3\n • New feature! In-page label printing. Learn more in our help documents. Now print labels via an in-page popup easily! This option is new and may contain a few errors still, so by default this option is not turned on. Turn it on via the Extension Settings.\n• Fixed bug where label print count wasn't showing along with prices not printing on labels.\n• Changed method to have Admin access to the extension options page to fix errors with past method. See help for more info.\n\n0.3.0.2: 1/17/23\n • Fixed bug on gift card page.\n\n0.3.0.1: 12/12/22\n • Fixed update page showing daily. Sorry!\n • A recent Lightspeed update is now printing a blank label at the end of roll labels on every print job due to an extra line of code in Lightspeed regardless of whether you use this extension or not. Vextend now removes this extra line of code to fix the error and save you labels!""]"

What I find though is that when I\'m angry, I forget about all the advice from business communication gurus. I hit the send button and ignore that little voice telling me \'Maybe you should have another think about that\'.\n\nSleep On It is designed to turn that little voice into a foghorn. It will use sentiment analysis technology to quickly scan your email when you press send. If it detects excessive levels of emotion, it will block the sending process and pop up a dialog: ""Are you sure you want to send this? You sound pretty annoyed. Maybe a phone call would be better.""\n\nMy goal with this project is to reduce workplace conflict. There\'s nothing worse than getting an angry email. Unlike a phone call or face to face, the other person doesn\'t get the opportunity to see your reaction. I would never say the things I have written via email in a face to face meeting but something about the Gmail interface shuts down my empathy sensors. The recipient becomes an isolated object rather than a human with emotions. \n\nIf you\'ve ever sent an email you regret, sign up for Sleep On It and stop your angry self from saying things your logical self would regret.\n\nSleep On It is a gmail extension that starts work when you press send.
